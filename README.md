Introduction:

Welcome to the HTML Foundations project! In this project, I'm starting with the basics of web development: HTML and CSS. I'll learn how to structure web pages, format text, create lists, add links, and insert images.
Skills Demonstrated:

By the end of this project, I'll have mastered:

HTML Elements and Tags: These are the building blocks of web pages. They help organize content and make it accessible.
HTML Boilerplate: Think of it as the starting point for web development. It includes essential code for setting up a webpage.
Text Formatting: We use tags to style text, like making headings or emphasizing certain words.
Lists: Lists help organize information neatly, whether itâ€™s a numbered list or bullet points.
Links and Images: We can add clickable links and images to our web pages.
Commit Messages: When working with code, clear and descriptive commit messages are crucial for collaboration.

This project builds upon my experience with HTML during my senior high school years. Understanding how to create and manipulate web pages using HTML is essential for modern web development, and this project will help me solidify my skills in this area.
